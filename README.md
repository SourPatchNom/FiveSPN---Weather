FiveSPN-Weather is a FiveM resource that syncs the game server weather between all players to up to four real world locations or a global override set by a server admin from within the game.

## Prerequisites

For best performance and monitoring, make sure the FiveSPN--Logger resource is utilized properly. This resource is available in the [Full Suite](https://github.com/SourPatchNom/FiveSPN---Suite) or from the [Source](https://github.com/SourPatchNom/FiveSPN---Logger)

## Installation

### Step One: Add the resource to your server.
Copy the folder inside of the FiveMResource folder into your server's resources folder and add it to the server.cfg with the following line. 
```
start FiveSPN-WeatherSync
```

### Step Two: Get an Open Weather Map API key for your server.

1. Goto https://openweathermap.org/
2. Register
3. Navigate to the API key area and generate a key for each server you are using.
4. Add the key to the FiveSPN-Weather resource manifest.

### Step Three: Add the source location to the locations.json file.

Using either a zip code, city id, or city name, add your source location to the locations.json file.

Default locations are Seattle, WA for Paleto, Phoenix for Blaine County, and Los Angeles for Los Santos.  

Using City Name
```javascript
{
    "Cities": [
        ["Seattle", -165.17, 6052.23, 80.03],
        ["Phoenix", 1398.82, 3977.76, 324.74],
        ["Los Angeles", -353.02, 523.95, 523.95]
    ],
    "Zips": [
        
    ],
    "Ids": [
        
    ]
}
```

Using Zip
```javascript

    "Zips": [
        [98101, -165.17, 6052.23, 80.03],
        [85323, 1398.82, 3977.76, 324.74],
        [90001, -353.02, 523.95, 523.95]
    ],
    "Ids": [

    ]
}
```

Using City Id (Find a cities id [here](https://openweathermap.org/find) by searching, then going to the city page and looking at url)
```javascript
{
    "Cities": [
        
    ],
    "Zips": [
        
    ],
    "Ids": [

        [5308655, 1398.82, 3977.76, 324.74],
